# The Big Three

The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript make up the "Big Three" languages of the front-end. They are the building blocks of nearly every website you've ever visited.

Each of these technologies has an important and distinct role to play on the front-end, as we'll see in this course.

- HTML: Structure
- CSS: Style
- JavaScript: Behavior

## Think of a House
To better understand the role each language plays on the front-end, it's helpful to visualize a house.

### HTML - Foundation and Framework
In a house, the foundation provides the structure and supports everything above it. Similarly, HTML is the foundation of a web page. It defines the structure and outlines the basic elements of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Just as rooms, walls, and doors form the structure of a house, HTML creates the structure of a webpage.

### CSS - Interior Design and Decoration
Once the house has its structure, it needs interior design to make it visually appealing. CSS is like the interior design of a web page. It controls the presentation and style, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. Like choosing paint colors, furniture, and decorations for different rooms in a house, CSS styles the various elements on a webpage to make it aesthetically pleasing.

### JavaScript - Home Automation and Functionality:
Now, imagine your house can adapt to different situations based on your needs. JavaScript provides the interactivity and dynamic functionality on a web page. It's like the smart home system that adds behavior to your house. JavaScript allows you to create responsive elements, handle user interactions, and update content dynamically. Just as home automation systems respond to user input, JavaScript makes a webpage responsive and interactive.
